# RetinaFace Optimization with Onnx & Quantization
The purpose of this reasearch is to investigate whether the RetinaFace model, utilizing MobileNet0.25 as its backbone, can operate in real-time on a Raspberry Pi 4 environment.  
I have installed Ubuntu 20.04 server on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM and then set up the Ubuntu Desktop environment. This setup is running on an armv7l architecture(32 bit).
